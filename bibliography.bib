Ground and excited-state properties can be computed up to the tin region, and from the proton to the presumptive neutron drip lines, providing unprecedented opportunities to confront two- plus three-nucleon interactions from chiral Effective Field Theory with experimental data. In this contribution, I will give a broad survey of the current status of nuclear many-body approaches, and I will use selected results to discuss both achievements and open issues that need to be addressed in the coming decade.},

The magic numbers associated with closed shells have long been assumed to be valid across the whole nuclear chart. Investigations in recent years of nuclei far away from nuclear stability at facilities for radioactive ion beams have revealed that the magic numbers may change locally in those exotic nuclei leading to the disappearance of classic shell gaps and the appearance of new magic numbers. These changes in shell structure also have important implications for the synthesis of heavy elements in stars and stellar explosions. In this review a brief overview of the basics of the nuclear shell model will be given together with a summary of recent theoretical and experimental activities investigating these changes in the nuclear shell structure.},

In nearly all applications, it is necessary to measure nuclear masses with very high precision. As mass measurements push to more short-lived and more massive nuclei, the practical constraints on mass measurement techniques become more exacting. Various techniques used to measure nuclear masses, including their advantages and disadvantages are described. Descriptions of some of the world facilities at which the nuclear mass measurements are performed are given, and brief summaries of planned facilities are presented. Future directions are mentioned, and conclusions are presented which provide a possible outlook and emphasis on upcoming plans for nuclear mass measurements at existing facilities, those under construction, and those being planned.},

	abstract = {Amid a rising threat of antimicrobial resistance in a global scenario, our huge investments and high-throughput technologies injected for rejuvenating the key therapeutic scaffolds to suppress these rising superbugs has been diminishing severely. This has grasped world-wide attention, with increased consideration being given to the discovery of new chemical entities. Research has now proven that the relatively tiny and simpler microbes possess enhanced capability of generating novel and diverse chemical constituents with huge therapeutic leads. The usage of these beneficial organisms could help in producing new chemical scaffolds that govern the power to suppress the spread of obnoxious superbugs. Here in this review, we have explicitly focused on several appealing strategies employed for the generation of new chemical scaffolds. Also, efforts on providing novel insights on some of the unresolved questions in the production of metabolites, metabolic profiling and also the serendipity of getting “hit molecules” have been rigorously discussed. However, we are highly aware that biosynthetic pathway of different classes of secondary metabolites and their biosynthetic route is a vast topic, thus we have avoided discussion on this topic.},

	abstract = {Multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometers ({MR}-{TOF}-{MS}) have recently been installed at different low-energy radioactive ion beam facilities. They are used as isobar separators with high ion capacity and as mass spectrometers with high mass resolving power and accuracy for short-lived nuclei. Furthermore, {MR}-{TOF}-{MS} have a huge potential for applications in other fields, such as chemistry, biology, medicine, space science, and homeland security. The development, commissioning and results of an {MR}-{TOF}-{MS} is presented, which serves as proof-of-principle to show that very high mass resolving powers (∼105) can be achieved in a compact device (length ∼30cm). Based on this work, an {MR}-{TOF}-{MS} for in situ application has been designed. For the first time, this device combines very high mass resolving power ({\textgreater}105), mobility, and an atmospheric pressure inlet in one instrument. It will enable in situ measurements without sample preparation at very high mass accuracy. Envisaged applications of this mobile {MR}-{TOF}-{MS} are discussed.},

In this review we focus on recent direct mass measurements conducted with storage rings and Penning trap mass spectrometry. Although these measurements have a broad impact, we restrict our discussion on two topics, namely nuclear astrophysics and neutrino physics.},

Ions of interest are long-lived highly charged nuclides up to bare uranium. Pentatrap aims for an accuracy of a few parts in 1012 for mass ratios of mass doublets. A physics program for Pentatrap includes Q-value measurements of β-transitions relevant for neutrino physics, stringent tests of quantum electrodynamics in the regime of extreme electric fields, and a test of special relativity. Main features of Pentatrap are an access to a source of highly charged ions, a multi-trap configuration, simultaneous measurements of frequencies, a continuous precise monitoring of magnetic field fluctuations, a fast exchange between different ions, and a highly sensitive cryogenic non-destructive detection system. This article gives a motivation for the new mass spectrometer Pentatrap, presents its experimental setup, and describes the present status.},
