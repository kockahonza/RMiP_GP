\section{Mass Spectrometry}
A Mass Spectrometer (MS) is a device used to measure the mass to charge ratio ($\frac{m}{Q}$) of ions.
Usually, this charge to mass ratio is calculated from either how much an ion is deflected in a magnetic field or accelerated in an electric field – ions with the same ratio are deflected/accelerated equally.
This information can be used for a variety of purposes such as determining an unknown isotope in a mixture or to directly measure nuclear masses.

The charge to mass ratio was first measured by J. J. Thomson in the late 19th century \cite{noauthor_j_nodate} and throughout the 20th century MS have evolved with numerous variations and different set ups.
This report focuses on 2 types of MS: the Penning trap and the Multiple Reflector Time of-Flight (MR-TOF) mass spectrometer, as both are currently used to measure the mass of exotic nuclei \cite{famiano_nuclear_2019}.

\subsection{Importance to nuclear theory}
Mass spectrometers are integral to the study of nuclear theory for identifying or quantifying unknown samples (ions) as well as measuring binding energy of particles to gain information about their nuclear structure.
Nuclear mass is a fundamental property which has been responsible for the discovery of many nuclear effects such as shell closures and nucleon-nucleon pairing \cite{blaum_precision_2012}.
MS are used in nuclear physics research to explore exotic nuclei such as neutron rich calcium isotopes \cite{wienholtz} which are interesting to study as they can develop our understanding of the nuclear force.
Examining binding energy is key to understanding the nuclear theory, it is related to the stability of the nuclei so the atoms in the valley of stability have the lowest binding energy as well.
% Examining this excess mass “defect” is the most important metaphor of nuclear physics: “the valley of stability” which has the lowest mass excess.
% Overweight nuclides that farther away from equilibrium tend to have their mass excess with much shorter half-lives which is defined by the binding energy.

\subsection{How do mass spectrometers work}
% A general MS has three stages: an ioniser, mass analyser and a detector.
Firstly, a sample must be ionised before entering the mass analyser so it will interact with the magnetic and/or electric fields.
Ionization methods including thermal ionization, where the sample is heated and emits ions on its own, and electron impact, where the sample is bombarded by electrons to excite the sample atoms which then emit ions.
% In the mass analyser the beam is accelerated/deflected before being incident on a detector.
% The detector then measures the mass charge ratio based on the time or location of incidence \cite{noauthor_mass_nodate}.
Then the ions go through different processes depending on the type of MS and at the end, the ions are usually detected using an electron multiplier giving the number ions arriving at a given time \cite{noauthor_mass_nodate}.
% The more ions hit a certain part of the detector it means the sample has more of that type of isotope in nature.
% And from all that, MS can generate the spectrum which is useful for analysing unknown samples.

\subsection{Penning traps}
Penning traps are the most common MS in nuclear study where there are currently at least 7 active laboratories including CPT, ISOLTRAP, TITAN and SHIPTRAP, they give us the most precise measurements for stable isotopes \cite{huang_ame_2021}.
Just 15 years ago, the only Penning trap spectrometer publishing the masses of radioactive samples was the pioneering experiment ISOLTRAP, set up at CERN’s ISOLDE facility in 1986 \cite{lunney_new_2019}. % RRR
Penning traps are based on a cyclotron design, and they trap the isotopes using a combination of strong longitudinal uniform magnetic and an quadrupole electric fields, high homogeneity also reduces the possibility of field drifts so that they move periodically and the frequency is related to mass following the equation
\begin{equation}
    \nu_c = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{qB}{m}
\end{equation}

To perform a mass measurement we then trap our sample in a Penning trap and scan through the suspected frequencies and measure the resonant response.
The response will be highest when many ions orbit at the given frequency, usually the sample would include an ion the mass of which is to be measured and a reference ion of known mass, the frequencies and masses are then related to each other.
From this also stems the main feature of Penning traps, it takes time to scan through the frequencies, meaning the more time available the more precise the measurement \cite{konig_quadrupole_1995}.

% The measured quantity is cyclotron frequency which can be essentially measured in high accuracy.
% Also, the coexistence of trapping and cooling minimizes systematic errors from mass measurement though the time it takes to complete a cycle is the main limitation of mass measurement which tends to limit the range of isotopic species that can be measured \cite{famiano_nuclear_2019}.

\subsection{MR-TOF mass spectrometers}
MR-TOF devices are the newest ion-trap development, first being used in 2013, they are often used accompanied with Penning traps.
Their greatest advantage is that they can provide measurements for isotopes with very low production rates and very short half-lives, which is particularly suitable for short lived nuclei as they can resolve in less than 30ms and are suited to rare nuclei as they can resolve small sample sizes \cite{noauthor_isoltraps_nodate}.
MR-TOF MSs work by reflecting the ions back and forth between two electrostatic mirrors in a short tube, effectively increasing the flight path length.
The key is that the speed of the ions depends on the mass-to-charge ratio, so after a while, the isotopes are detected, and the mass is calculated from the time of arrival through this equation
\begin{equation}
    t = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2U}}\sqrt{\frac{m}{q}}
\end{equation}

The main benefit of MR-TOF compared to Penning traps is that there is no need to scan through a variable.
The atoms simply arrive at the time and very high mass resolving power can be achieved in a small time, making them very well suited for measurements of very unstable nuclei (neutron rich in particular).
This is visualised in \cref{fig:MSPTMRTOF} which shows the achievable mass resolving power given an available observation time of a Penning trap and MR-TOF present at ISOLTRAP in CERN.

% MR-TOF MSs are usually faster and more sensitive as a non-scanning device with high ultra-mass resolving power than a Penning trap.
% It has several advantages compared to a frequency-based mass spectrometer also including the single-ion sensitivity, short cycle time (5ms) and superior resolving power for a measurement time of 1s and mass-to-charge ratio larger than hundreds of amu \cite{dickel_multiple-reflection_2013}.
