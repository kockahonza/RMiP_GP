\section{Summary}
 Mass spectrometers have been crucial in testing nuclear theories and pushing their limits.
 They have allowed for the exploration of the nuclear landscape closer to the neutron dripline where the 2 nucleon models have been insufficient in predicting the shell closures of these exotic nuclei.
 Future MS such as the PENTATRAP experiment with improved resolving power will be crucial in probing and improving the leading nuclear force theories. 
 
 In summary, the current research outlines the role of mass spectrometers in ongoing work in the field of nuclear physics.
 Nuclear physicists works on determining different masses of the nucleus and different isotopes and works on the fundamentals; we can build on a better future through this work.
 However, it is clear that there are still much to prove and disproof, and currently, we do not know how much is unknown.
 Nevertheless, there are many applications of mass spectrometers we are happy with; from water treatment to uses in space exploration, the technology of MS had a considerable impact on our lives.
