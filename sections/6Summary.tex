\section{Summary}
 In summary, the current research outlines the role of mass spectrometers in ongoing work in the field of nuclear physics.
 Nuclear physicists works on determining different masses of the nucleus and different isotopes and works on the fundamentals; we can build on a better future through this work.
 However, it is clear that there are still much to prove and disproof, and currently, we do not know how much is unknown.
 Nevertheless, there are many applications of mass spectrometers we are happy with; from water treatment to uses in space exploration, the technology of MS had a considerable impact on our lives.
